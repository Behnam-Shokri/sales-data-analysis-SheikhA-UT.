# 📊 Sales Data Analysis - SheikhA  (University of Tehran Project)

This project is part of my Data Science & Statistics coursework at the University of Tehran.  
The goal is to analyze sales data using Python and apply data science techniques, including:

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. Identifying Numerical and Categorical Features  
2. Handling Duplicate and Missing Data  
3. Outlier Detection (Z-Score, Boxplot)  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Histogram, KDE, Correlation, Pairplots)  
5. Data Preprocessing (Date Conversion, Encoding)  
6. Normalization and Train-Test Split  
7. Predictive Modeling:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
8. Model Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R², and MAPE

## ⚠️ Note on Methodology
In this version, outlier detection is performed **after** EDA.  
➡️ Future updates will revise the order to follow standard practices (detecting outliers before EDA).

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression Modeling & Evaluation

## 📁 File
- `sales_data_SheikhA.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook created and run in **Google Colab**, containing full analysis and code.
